    <h3>A delicious thai dish that adds its own twist to fried rice!</h3>
    <p>This dish differs from Chinese fried rice in that it is prepared with Thai jasmine rice instead of regular long-grain rice.
         It normally contains meat (chicken, shrimp, and crab are all common), egg, onions, garlic and sometimes tomatoes. 
         The seasonings, which may include soy sauce, sugar, salt, possibly some chili sauce, and the ubiquitous nampla (fish sauce), 
         are stir-fried together with the other ingredients. The dish is then plated and served with accompaniments like cucumber slices, 
         tomato slices, lime and sprigs of green onion and coriander, and phrik nampla, a spicy sauce made of sliced Thai chilies, chopped 
         garlic cloves, fish sauce, lime juice and sugar.
